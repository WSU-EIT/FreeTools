# 112 — CTO Wrap-Up: Example Pages Comprehensive Audit

> **Document ID:** 112  
> **Category:** Meeting  
> **Purpose:** Full audit of all 74 example pages for completeness, stubs, and functional polish.  
> **Audience:** CTO, devs, contributors.  
> **Predicted Outcome:** Identify any stubbed, placeholder, or incomplete example pages.  
> **Actual Outcome:** ✅ All 74 pages fully implemented. One minor polish gap found and fixed.  
> **Resolution:** Fix implemented in SampleItemsV1. Proposal doc created for 10 new categories.

## Audit Scope

Two-phase audit of every example page under `FreeExamples.Client/Pages/Examples/`:

1. **Completeness check** — Are any pages stubbed out, placeholder, or marked "planned for phase X"?
2. **Functional polish check** — Does pagination paginate? Do filters filter? Are sortable columns offered for sorting?

---

## Phase 1: Stub/Placeholder Scan

Searched all 74 `.razor` files for: `phase`, `planned`, `coming soon`, `not implemented`, `stub`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `placeholder`, `future`, `TBD`, `lorem ipsum`, `skeleton`, `NotImplementedException`.

**Result: Zero matches.** Every page has real content.

### Smallest Pages Verified

Manually read the smallest files (34–48 lines) to confirm they weren't empty shells:

| Page | Lines | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| NetworkGraphV2 | 34 | ✅ Full — dependency map with interactive nodes |
| TimerV5 | 45 | ✅ Full — event countdown with configurable target |
| SignalRV5 | 46 | ✅ Full — live scoreboard with real-time updates |
| NetworkGraphV1 | 48 | ✅ Full — org chart with expand/collapse |

All have InfoTips, interactive `@code` blocks, ExampleNav, and AboutSection components.

---

## Phase 2: Functional Polish Check

Examined every data-driven page for interactive completeness.

### Pages Audited

| Category | Pages | Pagination | Filters | Sort | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| SampleItems (main) | CRUD table | ✅ Server-side PagedRecordset | ✅ Status, Category, Enabled, Keyword | ✅ All non-GUID columns | ✅ Perfect |
| SampleItemsV1 | Card grid | N/A (loads all) | N/A | ⚠️ Missing Status + Enabled | **Fixed** |
| SampleItemsV2 | Split panel | N/A | ✅ Name filter | ✅ Sorted by Name | ✅ Correct for layout |
| SampleItemsV3 | Accordion | N/A | N/A | ✅ Grouped by Category, sorted by Name | ✅ Correct for layout |
| SampleItemsV4 | Timeline | N/A | N/A | ✅ Chronological | ✅ Correct for layout |
| SampleItemsV5 | Stats dashboard | N/A | N/A | N/A (aggregates) | ✅ Correct for layout |
| KanbanBoard | Drag-drop board | N/A | ✅ Category + search | ✅ Grouped by Status | ✅ Perfect |
| ComparisonTable | Transposed table | N/A | N/A | N/A (comparison layout) | ✅ Correct |
| SearchAutocomplete | Search | N/A | ✅ Debounced search | ✅ Sorted results | ✅ Perfect |
| ItemCards | Profile cards | N/A | ✅ Multi-select filter | ✅ Pre-sorted | ✅ Perfect |
| EditSampleItem | Edit form | N/A | N/A | N/A | ✅ Full validation + save + delete |

### V2–V5 Sort Justification

V2–V5 intentionally don't need the same sort controls as V1:
- **V2 (Split Panel):** Name filter + fixed Name sort — the layout is about selecting and viewing detail
- **V3 (Accordion):** Grouped by Category — the layout IS the sort
- **V4 (Timeline):** Chronological by DueDate — the layout IS the sort
- **V5 (Stats):** Aggregated numbers — no individual item ordering needed

## Issue Found and Fixed

### SampleItemsV1 — Missing Sort Options

**Problem:** Card grid sort dropdown offered Name, Amount, Priority, Category — but **Status** and **Enabled** are both displayed on every card and were missing from the sort dropdown.

**Fix applied:**

| Location | Change |
|----------|--------|
| Sort dropdown (line ~39) | Added `Sort: Status` and `Sort: Enabled` options |
| `SortItems()` switch (line ~96) | Added `"status" => OrderBy(Status).ThenBy(Name)` |
| | Added `"enabled" => OrderByDescending(Enabled).ThenBy(Name)` |

**File:** `FreeExamples.App.Pages.SampleItemsV1.razor`

Enabled sorts descending so enabled-first (✓ before ✗). Both have `.ThenBy(Name)` as secondary sort for consistency with the existing Category case.

## All 74 Pages — Final Inventory

### Dashboard & Data (9 pages)
SampleItems, V1–V5, SearchAutocomplete, ComparisonTable, ItemCards

### Files & Media (14 pages)
FileDemo, V1–V6, ImageGallery, Carousel, SignatureDemo, V1–V5

### UI Components (11 pages)
BootstrapShowcase, V1–V12, KanbanBoard, StatusBoard, PipelineTracker, WizardDemo, CommandPalette, CommentThread, ChatView

**Total: 74 pages, all fully implemented.**

## Next Steps: Proposed Expansion

Created `ProposedExamplePages.md` with 10 new entity-driven categories. Each follows the existing SampleItems pattern (data object + filter DTO + GetMany/SaveMany/DeleteMany + hub page + V1–V4 variants).

| # | Category | Core Pattern | Key Form Innovation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Work Orders | Status workflow + assignment | Cascading location dropdowns |
| 2 | Event Registration | Date/time + capacity | RSVP tracking + calendar grid |
| 3 | Equipment Checkout | Lending lifecycle | Condition assessment + availability |
| 4 | Budget Requests | Multi-line items + totals | Dynamic row add/remove |
| 5 | Room Reservations | Time-slot conflicts | Weekly calendar booking grid |
| 6 | Course Evaluations | Dynamic form rendering | Likert/rating/text from question data |
| 7 | Scholarship Applications | Multi-step wizard | Eligibility gating + rubric scoring |
| 8 | Parking Permits | Renewal cycles | Violation/appeal sub-workflow |
| 9 | Help Desk Tickets | Threaded conversation | Cascading dropdowns + SLA timers |
| 10 | Employee Onboarding | Checklist completion | Multi-party task tracking |

**Full details:** See `ProposedExamplePages.md`

### Decision Needed

> ⏸️ **CTO Input Needed**
>
> **Question:** Which categories to build first?
>
> **Options:**
> 1. Start with 2–3 highest-value categories
> 2. Build all 10 in sequence
> 3. Modify the list first (add/remove/combine categories)
>
> **Recommendation:** Start with Work Orders (#1) and Help Desk Tickets (#9) — they're the most universally useful at a university and showcase the most distinct patterns from what already exists (status workflows, threaded conversations, SLA tracking).
